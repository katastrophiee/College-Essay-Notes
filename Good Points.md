User Acceptance Criteria

UACs are the conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by a user, a customer, or other systems
Some examples for a different piece of software:
```
•Must have a membership system that allows the user to access extra content.
• Must allow clients to add new content without touching the code.
• Must be compatible with various devices, such as a desktop, a tablet and a
smartphone.
• Should have different page layouts based on the user (e.g. client can add content,
but members can only watch content).
• The layout should be simple and easy to navigate, so information should be diluted
across the page (no clutter to confuse the user). Also, text information should be
balanced with images and other media.
• Could use external services to provide content (e.g. use YouTube to display free
videos).
• Could add advertisements to monetise the free content without making the user
pay
```
