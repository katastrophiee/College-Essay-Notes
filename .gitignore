First - Research:

```
• Understand the breif
Discuss:
• common problems and risks
• hardware and software uses in context
• newly emerging technologies
• other related solutions/software
• business context and legislation
• plan for short falls and gaps in knowledge - say how you're gonna make up
```


Second - Planning and Requirements Analysis:

```
Discuss:
• business requirements (new software, increase security)
• how effective it is at doing what its supposed to
• break down into smaller problems using decomposition, pattern recognition and abstraction
• state the functional and non-functional 
• state the KPIs
• state performance restrictions in digital projects
• user acceptance criteria - does it meet the requirements
• schedule projects
• allocate appropriate resources
• estimate costs
• approopriate languages
• use user input and ERDs
```


Third - Getting user input

```
• user stories
• mind maps
• entity relationship diagram
```


Fourth - Designing the product

```
• UI design
• Plan to solve key problems (do algorithms for atleast 5 complicated tasks (validation))
• Data requirements 
• Proof of concept
• Initial testing schedule
```


Fifth - Developing and testing

```
• Create prototype
• Test using modular, automated and user testing and feedback
```


Sixth - Deploying and implementing the product

```
• Install and configure
• Update

```

Seventh - Maintenance

```
• Provide system support
• provide user support
• Carry out bug fixes
• User training
```
