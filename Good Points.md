Functional and Non-Functional

A functional requirement defines a system or its component that it needs in order to function as intended, whereas a non-functional requirement defines the performance attribute of a software system adn what it needs to do in order to function well.

KPIs

A KPI is a quantifiable measure of performance of the app over time. It allows us to notice where changes are needed and make them. Operational are short term KPIs, while strategic are long term

Things to think about:
```
• responsiveness 
• load handling
• reliability
```

User Acceptance Criteria

Page 22

UACs are the conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by a user, a customer, or other systems
Some examples for a different piece of software:
```
•Must have a membership system that allows the user to access extra content.
• Must allow clients to add new content without touching the code.
• Must be compatible with various devices, such as a desktop, a tablet and a
smartphone.
• Should have different page layouts based on the user (e.g. client can add content,
but members can only watch content).
• The layout should be simple and easy to navigate, so information should be diluted
across the page (no clutter to confuse the user). Also, text information should be
balanced with images and other media.
• Could use external services to provide content (e.g. use YouTube to display free
videos).
• Could add advertisements to monetise the free content without making the user
pay
```

```
• access the web page

A ii - Proposal:

```
Decomposing:
  • identify problems
  • decompose problwm
  • meet full needs of breif
  • prevent potential risks
  • address guidelines and legal requirements
  
Wider issues in context:
  • meets needs of user and client
```

Data protection Act - controls how your personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government - relates to the fact that users data will be handled by company

Handling childrens data - Under 13s cannot consent to gdpr - to ensure that children are addressed in plain clear language that they can understand. Transparency and accountability are important where children’s data is concerned and this is especially relevant when they are accessing online services. Children are less aware of the risks
Add disclamer for creating teacher account, under 13 must have parent regesiter for them

Computer Misuse act - The Computer Misuse Act protects personal data held by organisations from unauthorised access and modification

Another way to assess non-functional is using FURPS model, which FURPS is an acronym for functionality, usability, reliability, performance and supportability
