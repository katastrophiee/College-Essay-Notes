First - Research:

```
• Understand the breif
Discuss:
• common problems and risks
• hardware and software uses in context
• newly emerging technologies
• other related solutions/software
• business context and legislation
• plan for short falls and gaps in knowledge - say how you're gonna make up
```

Second - Planning and Requirements Analysis:

```
Discuss:
• business requirements (new software, increase security)
• how effective it is at doing what its supposed to
• break down into smaller problems using decomposition, pattern recognition and abstraction
• state the functional and non-functional 
• state the KPIs
• state performance restrictions in digital projects
• user acceptance criteria - does it meet the requirements
• schedule projects
• allocate appropriate resources
• estimate costs
• approopriate languages
• use user input and ERDs
```

Third - Designing the product

```
• UI design
• Plan to solve 
```


Algorithms

```
• do algorithms for atleast 5 complicated tasks (validation)
```
